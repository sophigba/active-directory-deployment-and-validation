# 4. Technical Troubleshooting
During the deployment and validation phases, several critical blockers were encountered across the various platforms.
This section details those issues and the steps taken to resolve them.


## 4.2 Splunk Server Access
* After successfully setting up the Splunk server, all efforts to access the web interface proved futile.

* Root Cause: The Splunk Server was initially configured on the NAT network that isolated the guest OS from the physical host.

* Resolution: A host-Only adapter was added and enabled using dhcp client. This served as a secondary network interface to the Splunk server.

To link - `sudo ip link set enp0s8 up`
Request IP - `sudo dhclinet enp0s8`

## 4.1 The "SID" Error
* During the brute force attempt, Hydra returned an error: `account might be valid but account not active for remote desktop`, even though the user `b.shark` was correctly added to the Remote Desktop Users group.

* Root Cause: A fundamental DNS misconfiguration on the Target-PC. Because the Target machine's primary DNS was pointing to an external gateway rather than the Domain Controller, it could not resolve Security Identifiers (SIDs) to Domain names. This caused the RDP service to fail the authorisation check because it couldn't verify the group membership of the user.

* Resolution: DNS Correction: Updated the Network Adapter settings on the Target-PC to point to the Domain Controller's IP (192.168.10.10) and forced a reregistration in powershell using the following commands:
  `ipconfig /flushdns`
  `ipconfig /registerdns`

## 4.3 Splunk Ingestion Latency
*In the Splunk Web UI, security logs were appearing with significant lag or not at all, accompanied by "Ingestion Latency" warnings. 

* Root Cause: The default throughput limit of 256 KBps was insufficient for the burst of security events generated by the attack.
  
*Resolution: Manually edited the Indexer's configuration to remove the throttle.
File Path: `/opt/splunk/etc/system/local/limits.conf`
Configuration:
`[thruput]
maxKBps = 0`

## 4.4 Shared Folder Integration
The Splunk Universal Forwarder `.msi` needed to be transferred to be installed on the Target-PC and Domain Controller for the telemetry pipeline setup but due to ignificant performance lag, downlaods were not feasible. 

To resolve this, the following steps were done:
* I navigated to the optical drive `Z://...`  and manually installed the `VBoxWindowsAdditions-amd64.exe` as an Administarator.

* Once Guest Additions were manually installed and the VM was rebooted.
* A shared folder was set-up to host the Splunk Universal Forwarder installer, which was then accessed through the VM.
